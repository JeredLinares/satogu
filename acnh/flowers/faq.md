# Reproduction

> ###### I had [Flower A] and [Flower B] make [Flower C], is this normal ?

Yes.

> ###### I had [Flower A] and [Flower B] make [Flower C], why is this combination not in your guide ?

Because listing every possible combination is not the point of the guide. There are 12,393 different flower combinations, each with multiple possible outcomes. If you want to see the results of a particular combination, use the [simulator](https://gardenscience.ac/).

> ###### Can this flower clone ?
>

All flowers can clone except for gold rose and lily of the valley.

> ###### Does moving a flower affects reproduction rates ?

Yes. Digging up a flower will clear both its water and visitor counters, which means its reproduction chance will be reset to the base 5%.

# Watering

> ###### Do I need to water flowers if it has rained during this day ?
>

No. Any water is water.

> ###### Do I need to water flowers which have already been watered during this day ?
>

No. Any water is water.

> ###### Does water from local islanders count as visitor watering ?
>

No. Visitors are people who visit. Local islanders are not visiting.

> ###### Does water from local villagers count as visitor watering ?
>

No. Visitors are people who visit. Local villagers are not visiting. 

> ###### Does rain count as visitor watering ?
>

No. Visitors are people who visit. Rain is not people.

# Gold Rose

> ###### Do black roses need to breed to produce gold rose ?
>

No. A single gold-flagged black rose can still produce a gold rose when cloning.

> ###### Do gold rose clone ?
>

No.

> ###### Can regular watering cans or rain create gold roses ?
>

No. If you get a gold rose after watering with a regular can or rain, it's because your black rose already had the gold flag. Rain only triggered the roll for reproduction, like any water does. Any water is water.
