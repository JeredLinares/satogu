# Reproduction

> ###### How to get hybrids ?

Hybrid is a loosely term with no useful meaning in this context.

If what you want is producing non-base color flowers, please follow the [Simple Flower Guide](https://aiterusawato.github.io/satogu/acnh/flowers/simple.html).

> ###### I had [Flower A] and [Flower B] make [Flower C], is this normal ?

Yes.

This is how flower breeding works.

> ###### I had [Flower A] and [Flower B] make [Flower C], why is this combination not in your guide ?

Because listing every possible combination is not the point of the guide.

There are 12,393 different flower combinations, each with multiple possible outcomes. If you want to see the results of a particular combination, use the [Flower Breeding Simulator](https://gardenscience.ac/).

> ###### Can this flower clone ?
>

All flowers can clone except for gold rose and lily of the valley.

> ###### Does moving a flower affects reproduction rates ?

Yes.

Digging up a flower will clear both its water and visitor counters, which means its reproduction chance will be reset to the base 5%.

# Watering

> ###### Do I need to water flowers if it has rained during this day ?
>

No.

Watering flowers is for hydrating them. Once they have been hydrated during the current day, there is no point in hydrating them again.

> ###### Do I need to water flowers which have already been watered during this day ?
>

No.

Watering flowers is for hydrating them. Once they have been hydrated during the current day, there is no point in hydrating them again.

> ###### Does water from local islanders count as visitor watering ?
>

No.

Visitors are people who visit. Local islanders are not visiting.

> ###### Does water from local villagers count as visitor watering ?
>

No.

Visitors are people who visit. Local villagers are not visiting. 

> ###### Does rain count as visitor watering ?
>

No.

Visitors are people who visit. Rain is not people.

# Gold Rose

> ###### How to get a gold rose ?

Have a black rose directly watered by a golden watering can.

The golden watering can waters a three-by-three area, and if a black rose is on the center tile of that area, it will receive a hidden attribute called the gold flag. When a black rose with the gold flag reproduces, it will have 50% chance of consuming its gold flag to produce a gold rose instead of regular offspring.

A black rose will keep its gold flag until producing a gold rose, even when moved or given to another player.

> ###### Does a black rose have to breed in order to produce a gold rose ?
>

No.

 When a black rose with the gold flag reproduces, it will have 50% chance of consuming its gold flag to produce a gold rose instead of regular offspring, regardless of the reproduction mode (cloning or breeding).

> ###### Can gold roses clone ?
>

No.

> ###### Can regular watering cans or rain produce gold roses ?
>

No.

If you get a gold rose from a black rose watered by a regular can or by rain, it's because that black rose already had the gold flag in the first place, which means it had been watered by a golden watering can previously, either by you or by another player. The regular water from regular watering can or rain only triggered the roll for reproduction.

# Lily of the Valley

> ###### What is lily of the valley ?

Lily of the valley is a special flower.

It cannot reproduce, plucked or trampled, and has no known effect.

> ###### How to get a lily of the valley ?

Have your island reach a five-star rating and wait.

As long as your island has a five-star rating, lilies of the valley will have a chance to spawn in front of your island's cliffs during the daily refresh.

> ###### Can lilies of the valley breed / clone ?

No.

> ###### Does lily of the valley have any special effect ?

Not as far as we know.
