## Specialty & Village Flowers

Every island has a specialty flower and a village flower. They are determined when the island is created, based on the main player's birth month and the current month. They will always be two different species, even if the island's creation month and the main player's birth month share common flower species.

* Specialty flower will spawn naturally on the island cliffs on its creation.
* Village flower will always be sold at the shop.
* Both will be the only species to appear on mystery islands.

## Seed Flowers

Base flower seeds can be bought at shops. Flowers grown from them will always have their default genotypes.

* Nook Shop sells your village flower species and another species (specialty or monthly not confirmed).
* Nook's Cranny also sells a third monthly flower species, different from your specialty and village flowers. It rotates every week on Mondays (not confirmed).
* Leif sells two flower species randomly chosen from those unavailable during the current month (not confirmed).

## Wild Flowers

Wild flowers are naturally generated when an island is created. They will always have their default genotype.

* Main island will spawn base color specialty flowers on the cliffs upon creation.
* Mystery islands will spawn base (95%) or tier one (5%) of either specialty or village flowers (50% each).

> ![Warning][]**Main Island Wild Flowers**
>
> By the time you are able to reach your main island's cliffs, the original wild flowers there might have already reproduced and bred because of rain. In this case, you will not be able to know which ones have their default genotype. Because of this, it is advised to not use any of your original cliff flowers which has adjacent flowers.
>
> If you want already-grown flowers to use as a quick replacement for seed flowers, you can use wild flowers from mystery islands instead.



Each month of the year has a pool of monthly available flower species. There is a six-month shift between the two hemispheres.

Timmy and Tommy will always sell one of the monthly species, while Leif will sell two of the non-monthly species.
