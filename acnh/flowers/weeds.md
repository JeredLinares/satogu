Weeds can spawn, grow and spread on your island as long as their total population is inferior to 150.

> While it's intended for weeds to stop spawning and spreading after 150, reaching this cap will also prevent them from growing. It's unknown if this behavior is inteded or if it is or an overlook.

# Weed Spawning

Weeds spawn naturally on islands, as long as their total population is inferior 150. Every day, a few weeds will spawn, depending on the current total number of weeds on the island.

| Current Weed Population | New Weeds per day |
| :---------------------- | :---------------: |
| 0 - 30                  |         2         |
| 31 - 149                |         1         |
| 150+                    |         0         |

# Weed Growth

Weeds have three growth stages, and always spawn at stage one. Every day, weeds on your island have a chance to grow to their next stage, depending on their current stage and their watered state.

| Growth Stage      | Growth Chance, Unwatered | Growth Chance, Watered |
| :---------------- | :----------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Stage 1 → Stage 2 |           20%            |          50%           |
| Stage 2 → Stage 3 |            5%            |          10%           |

# Weed Spreading

Weeds can also spread. Every day, weeds on your island have a chance to spawn additional weeds on a tile adjacent to theirs, depending on their current growth stage and their watered state.

| Growth Stage | Spreading Chance, Unwatered | Spreading Chance, Watered |
| :----------- | :-------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Stage 1      |             0%              |            5%             |
| Stage 2      |             10%             |            20%            |
| Stage 3      |             80%             |           100%            |
